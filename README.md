# ideas

- screen for accents
- screen for emojis
  - emojis could be inserted into text areas using `:emoji-names:` kinda like discord
- screen for inserting latex

# google apps

- google docs uses canvas for the page, maybe use copy paste for that one? (and other complicated ones?)

# notes

We have to use `react-redux@7` instead of `react-redux@latest` because of [this](https://github.com/tshaddix/webext-redux/issues/280) open issue.
